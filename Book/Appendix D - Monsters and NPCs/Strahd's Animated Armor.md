The armor that Strahd wore into battle when he was alive lives on today as a headless, animated suit of plate armor. The armor is painted burgundy and adorned with golden angelic motifs.

**Thing of Evil.** Strahd imbued his automaton with a sliver of his being, bequeathing unto his armor a malevolence not found in most animated objects. He also fortified his armor and placed a  number of permanent spell effects on it to make the armor a better castle defender. 

The armor understands Common but obeys only the commands of its master.
