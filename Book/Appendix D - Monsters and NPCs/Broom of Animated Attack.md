A broom of animated attack is easily mistaken for a *broom of flying*. It attacks any creature that grabs it or tries to ride it.

**Flying Broom.** Some brooms of animated attack allow their creators to ride them, in which case they behave like typical *brooms of flying*. A broom of animated attack, however, can carry only half the weight that a *broom of flying* can (see chapter 7, "Treasure," of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).
