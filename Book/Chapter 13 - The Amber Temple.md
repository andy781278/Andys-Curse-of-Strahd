A secret society of good-aligned wizards built the Amber Temple in the Balinok Mountains more than two thousand years ago. They needed a vault in which to contain the evil vestiges (remnants
of dead, malevolent entities) they had captured and the hoard of forbidden knowledge they had amassed. They dedicated the temple to a god of secrets, whom they trusted to keep it hidden from the rest of the world until the end of time. Unfortunately for the wizards, even the will of a god couldn't prevent other evil creatures from learning the temple's location. The wizards were forced to guard the temple themselves, to keep its secrets from falling into villainous hands. The evil forces that were imprisoned within the temple eventually corrupted the wizards, turning them against one another.

The wizards were dead and gone by the time an evil archmage named Exethanter arrived at the temple. He breached the temple's wards, spoke to a vestige trapped in amber, and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. After his transformation , the lich Exethanter took over the temple and turned the skulls of it previous defenders into flameskulls under his command. Exethanter then
took it upon himself to watch over the temple, not to hoard its evil secrets but to share them openly. Meanwhile, the evils within the temple fed on each other, growing in power.

When Strahd came to the temple seeking immortality, Exethanter sensed that he was a man of destiny. The evil powers in the temple felt something much stronger: a darkness that eclipsed their own. Strahd communed with these evil vestiges and forged a pact with them. When Strahd later murdered his brother Sergei, that pact was sealed with blood. Strahd transformed into a vampire, and the Dark Powers turned his land into a prison.

Strahd has returned to the temple several times to learn new magic and to find a means of escaping his fate, but the Dark Powers have no intention of giving him up. These recent years have been difficult for Exethanter, whose body and mind have been falling apart. The lich has grown weak and forgetful. He no longer remembers his name or his spells. He knows only that the Dark Powers that created Strahd's domain were born in the temple, and that these entities feed on the
evil that Strahd represents. Strahd is the darkness that sustains them.

Characters who visit the temple can sense the presence of great evil. The dark vestiges imprisoned within the temple will try to corrupt them, offering them secrets and gifts in exchange for a taste of the evil that lurks within their true hearts.

EXTREME COLD
The Amber Temple is a cold, dark place carved out of the snowy slope of Mount Ghakis. The temperature throughout the complex is -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius). Characters who don't have heat sources, cold weather gear, or magic to protect them are subject to the effects of extreme cold, as described in the "Weather" section in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. If Kasimir Velikov (see [[Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N9A. KASIMIR'S HOVEL]]) is with the party, his *ring of warmth* protects him from the effects of the extreme cold.

I WOULD NOT BE CALLED 'DEATH'
so soon. I made a pact with death,
a pact of blood.
-Tome of Strahd

# AREAS OF THE TEMPLE
All the doors in the temple are fashioned from blocks of translucent amber with iron hinges and fittings. Unless otherwise noted, arrow slits in the temple are 5 inches wide, 4 feet tall, and 1 foot thick.

![[Amber Temple Upper Level Map.jpg]]

## X1. TEMPLE FACADE
A snow-swept gravel road climbs the mountainside as it travels north from Tsolenka Pass toward the temple. When the characters reach the end of this road, read:

==The road fades away under a covering of snow, but it takes you far enough to see the facade of some kind of temple carved into the sheer mountainside ahead. The front of the structure is fifty feet high and has six alcoves containing twenty-foot-tall statues. Each statue is carved from a single block of amber and depicts a faceless, hooded figure, its hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer. Between the two innermost statues is a twenty-foot-tall archway with a staircase leading down.==

The amber statues are impervious to damage. Looking at one for long fills a viewer with unease.

### X1A. NARROW FISSURE
==A natural fissure has opened in the mountainside west of the temple's facade, creating a gap two feet wide, ten feet tall, and fifteen feet deep. You see light coming from a room beyond, and you hear human voices there as well.==

The fissure leads to area [[#X15. SOUTHWEST ANNEX]]. If the characters make a Jot of noise outside, one of the creatures in that area investigates the disturbance.

## X2. ENTRANCE
If the characters pass through the archway between the statues, read:

==Icy steps descend ten feet to a time-ravaged hallway with arrow slits in the walls. Beyond the hall lies a vast, sepulchral darkness.==

The hall connects areas [[#X1. TEMPLE FACADE]] and [[#X4. OVERLOOK]]. There are no guards in the rooms behind the arrow slits (areas [[#X2A. GUARD ROOM]] and [[#X2B. GUARD ROOM]]).

### X2A. GUARD ROOM
This empty room lies behind a secret door. The ceiling is 10 feet high. Two arrow slits are carved into the east wall.

### X2B. GUARD ROOM
This room lies behind a secret door.

==Two arrow slits are carved into the west wall of this 10-foot-high, twenty-foot-square room. Slumped in the northeast corner is a skeleton wearing a blue wizard's robe and clutching a wand to its chest.==

The skeleton is all that remains of a wizard who froze to death. It poses no threat.

TREASURE
The skeleton clutches a *wand of secrets*.

## X3. EMPTY BARRACKS
==Shattered bits of wood cover the floor of this frigid, twenty-foot-square room.==

The ceiling in each of these rooms is 10 feet high. The wood is all that remains of guards' bunks.
A secret door set in one wall of each room can be pulled open to reveal area [[#X2A. GUARD ROOM]] or [[#X2B. GUARD ROOM]] beyond.

## X4. OVERLOOK
==A twenty-foot-wide balcony of black marble with a shattered railing overlooks a vast temple. Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend thirty feet to the temple floor. The vaulted ceiling is thirty feet above the balcony. The walls and ceiling are covered in an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen. A set of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony. A similar pair stands open to the east.==

Anyone with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notice arrow slits in the walls overlooking the temple (see areas [[#X8. UPPER EAST HALL]] and [[#X17. UPPER WEST HALL]] for more information on these arrow slits). If the characters' light source or vision extends 90 feet or more, they can see a large, faceless statue at the far end of the temple (area [[#X5A. GOD OF SECRETS]]).

The open doorway to the east leads to area [[#X6. SOUTHEAST ANNEX]]. The double doors to the west open into area [[#X15. SOUTHWEST ANNEX]]. Characters who listen at the western doors hear gruff humanoid voices beyond, but can't discern what's being said.

## X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS
==Four black marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of the temple, at the north end of which stands a forty-foot-tall statue of a cowled figure in flowing robes. The statue's stony hands are outstretched as if in the midst of casting a spell. Its face is a void of utter blackness.==

==The ominous statue stands between two black marble balconies, one of which has partially collapsed and fallen on the temple's black marble floor, in front of an open doorway. The walls of the temple are sheathed in amber, and the doors leading from it are made of amber as well. Arched hallways coated with amber lead away from the temple to the west and east. Flanking these exits are alcoves that hold white marble statues of robed human wizards with pointed hats and golden staffs. One of them has toppled over and lies shattered on the floor.==

An **arcanaloth** named Neferon guards this temple from within the hollow head of the great statue (area [[#X5A. GOD OF SECRETS]]) and attacks characters on sight with its longer-ranged spells. Thanks to its truesight, the arcanaloth can see the invisible and can see through magical darkness. Characters can't see Neferon unless they can penetrate the magical darkness that envelops the statue's face and head.

Once the arcanaloth begins casting spells, the three **flameskulls** in area [[#X17. UPPER WEST HALL]] take up positions behind the arrow slits that overlook the temple and cast *magic missile* and *fireball* spells at characters they can see.

The temple ceiling is 60 feet high. Wide, black marble staircases ascend 30 feet to the southern balcony (area [[#X4. OVERLOOK]]). The balconies that flank the statue (areas [[#X11. NORTHEAST BALCONY]] and [[#X23. NORTHWEST BALCONY]]) are 30 feet high as well.

Arrow slits cut into the walls of the upper galleries (areas [[#X8. UPPER EAST HALL]] and [[#X17. UPPER WEST HALL]]) and archer posts (areas [[#X13. EAST ARCHER POST]] and [[#X25. WEST ARCHER POST]]) look down on the temple. The amber glaze that covers the temple walls makes these arrow slits difficult to spot. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notice them. Creatures behind the arrow slits gain three-quarters cover.

The marble wizard statues stand 8 feet tall. Their 9-foot-tall golden staffs are made of wrought iron coated in peeling gold paint. The northeast statue fell over when an earth tremor collapsed the wall of its alcove.

### X5A. GOD OF SECRETS
This 40-foot-tall statue, carved out of granite, depicts a faceless god of secrets. At the base of the statue, in the back, is a secret door that can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. It can be pulled open to reveal a spiral staircase that climbs to a stone trapdoor set into the floor of the statue's hollow head.

STATUE'S HEAD
Neferon the **arcanaloth** lairs inside the statue's hollow head, within a field of magical darkness that fills the interior of the head and hides the statue's humanlike face. The darkness can be dispelled (DC 17).

A pair of 2-foot-wide eyeholes provides an unobstructed view of the temple floor south of the statue, as well as the southern balcony (area [[#X4. OVERLOOK]]). Looking through the eyes, one can't see the northern balconies (areas [[#X11. NORTHEAST BALCONY]] and [[#X23. NORTHWEST BALCONY]]), the areas beneath them, or anywhere behind or directly above the statue. The eyeholes grant the arcanaloth three-quarters cover against attacks that originate outside the head.

Neferon wears gold spectacles and a magic robe (see "Treasure" below). It uses its *alter self* spell and Deception skill to pass itself off as an old human wizard with a long white beard named Heinrich Stolt. "Heinrich" feigns confusion. If the characters ask him why he attacked, he claims that he was guarding the temple. If the arcanaloth loses more than half of its hit points, it teleports to the temple floor, turns invisible, and flees by the safest route, attacking the characters again when it's safe to do so. The arcanaloth will not, under any circumstances, leave the Amber Temple.

TREASURE
The arcanaloth carries a spellbook containing the wizard spells it has prepared (see its stat block in the *Monster Manual*). It wears small gold spectacles with pink crystal lenses (worth 250 GP) and a *robe of useful items* with the following eight patches remaining:
- Bag of 100 GP
- Pit
- Iron door
- Rowboat
- Wooden ladder
- *Spell scroll (moonbeam)*
- Riding horse
- Mastiffs
See the robe's description in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information on each patch.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's lying on the floor inside the statue's head.

### X5B. SECRET DOOR
Set into the middle of the temple's north wall is a secret door. A character who searches the wall for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check detects seams in the amber glaze that covers the wall, hinting at the presence of the door. It is warded by an *arcane lock* spell that prevents it from being opened, but knocking on the door three times causes it to swing open for 1 minute, revealing a dusty stone staircase. The stairs climb 30 feet to another secret door that swings open automatically when a creature moves within 5 feet of it. The stairs lead to area X30.
### X5C. LOCKED DOORS
These amber doors are sealed with an arcane lock spell. The password to suppress it is "Etherna." A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 · Strength check. The doors (AC 15, 60 hit points) can also be smashed. If they are reduced to 0 hit points, necrotic energy fills the 30-foot cube directly north of them. A creature in that area takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, turning to dust if reduced to 0 hit points. Beyond the doors lie the temple catacombs (area [[#X31. CENTRAL CATACOMBS]]).

### X5D. AMBER REFLECTIONS
==This arched hall rises to a height of twenty feet. You can see your reactions in the amber glaze. But the images don't mirror your movements. Instead, they wave their arms and scream silent warnings to you.==

The characters' bizarre reflections are illusions meant to discourage them from exploring the temple. The illusions can be dispelled (DC 15).

The east hall leads to area [[#X32. LOWER EAST HALL]], the west hall to area [[#X36. LOWER WEST HALL]].

## X6. SOUTHEAST ANNEX
==This room is featureless except for a rough-edged, 10-foot-diameter circular hole in the floor to the east and empty torch sconces along the walls. Double doors of amber stand open to the north and west. A single closed door lies just south of the western set of double doors.==

The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Beyond the open doors to the north, the characters can see a long, wide hallway with amber-covered walls (area [[#X8. UPPER EAST HALL]]).

The hole in the floor forms a roughly hewn shaft that descends 20 feet, then breaks through the ceiling of area [[#X33A. VAULT OF SHALX]]. From the bottom of the shaft, it's another 10-foot drop to the floor of area [[#X33A. VAULT OF SHALX]]. The shaft has abundant handholds and can be climbed without an ability check, but characters must still drop the last 10 feet to reach the floor below. If the characters make a lot of noise, the three **flameskulls** in area [[#X33A. VAULT OF SHALX]] float up the shaft and attack them. The flameskulls also attack anyone they can hear attempting to descend the shaft.

A secret door in the south wall opens into area [[#X7. SECRET SCROLL REPOSITORY]].

## X7. SECRET SCROLL REPOSITORY
==Carved into the south wall of this dusty space are cylindrical holes fit for scrolls or maps.==

The wizards kept magic scrolls here in case the temple came under attack. The scrolls have crumbled to dust.

## X8. UPPER EAST HALL
==Glazed amber covers the walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor. The amber doors at both ends of the hall stand open. A closed door is in the middle of the east wall, and three arrow slits are cut into the wall across from it. Cracks in the black marble floor run the length of the hall.==

The cracks in the floor were made by the golem in area [[#X10. NORTHEAST ANNEX]]. The arrow slits are 5 inches wide, 2 1/2 feet tall, and 1 foot thick. They look down on the temple (area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]).

## X9. LECTURE HALL

==This chamber is brightly lit by red copper lanthorns that l hang from the ceiling. The walls are sheathed in amber that has been shaped into bas-reliefs of wizards with spell books. Stairs to the north and south descend twenty feet to an obsidian lectern, behind which a slab of black slate hangs from chains. Between the stairs are descending rows of red marble benches.==

The hanging lanthorns have *continual light* spells cast on them. The black slate slab once served as a chalkboard and has a few chalk marks on it.

Hiding behind the lectern is Vilnius (NE male human **mage**) and his invisible **quasit** familiar. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher notice him. A character who actively searches the room for hidden occupants spots Vilnius with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

![[Vilinus and Quasit.png]]

Vilnius wears scorched robes, his unkempt hair is half burned away, and his face and arms are covered with blisters from magic fire. He is the apprentice of Jakarion, the dead wizard in area [[#X17. UPPER WEST HALL]]. After the flameskulls there incinerated his master, the wounded Vilnius retreated here. He eats vermin to survive. The amber golem has been patrolling the hallway outside (area [[#X8. UPPER EAST HALL]]), and Vilnius won't leave this room until he knows the golem has been destroyed.

Vilnius is a greedy, treacherous coward. He curses his dead master for leading them to this wretched land. If the characters try to befriend him, be is suspicious of their intentions. He would like to retrieve bis dead master's staff and spellbook, but otherwise he has no interest in exploring more of the Amber Temple. He knows the following information about the place:
- The temple is a haven for forbidden knowledge.
- Flameskulls- constructs made from the remains of dead wizards- guard the temple.
- Barbaric mountain folk use the temple for shelter.

TREASURE
Vilnius carries his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also has a gold amulet shaped like an upside-down V hidden under his robes. Of exquisite design, the amulet is worth 1,000 GP. It is the control amulet for the shield guardian in area [[#X35. SLEEPING GUARDIAN]].

Although he can tell that the amulet is magical, he doesn't know its purpose. The amulet thrums when it comes within 10 feet of the shield guardian. If Vilnius realizes what the amulet does, he won't part with it.

## X10. NORTHEAST ANNEX
==The walls and ceiling in the eastern portion of this bare stone room have collapsed. To the west and south are open amber doors. In the center of the room is a ten-foot-tall statue of a jackal-headed warrior made of cracked amber. It turns to face you and clenches its fists.==

The ceiling here is 20 feet high, and the walls are lined with empty torch sconces. The statue is a damaged amber golem (use the stat block for the **stone golem** in the *Monster Manual*). It has 145 hit points and attacks any creature it sees, stopping only when it can't see any.

An earthquake collapsed the eastern part of the room long ago.

## X11. NORTHEAST BALCONY
==This black marble balcony, thirty feet above the floor, overhangs the northeast corner of the temple. The two amber doors leading from this balcony stand open.==

Characters can see an arrow slit west of the northern set of doors (see area [[#X13. EAST ARCHER POST]]).

## X12. EAST SHRINE
==This bare stone room consists of a foyer to the west and a shrine to the east. Four candlesticks lie on the dusty floor of the foyer. In the shrine, fragments of a shattered obsidian statue are  scattered in a raised alcove at the eastern end of the chamber. Two pairs of empty alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.==

The amber golem in area [[#X10. NORTHEAST ANNEX]] knocked over the candies ticks and pulverized the obsidian statue, which depicted the same nameless god that stands in area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]. Amber doors in the west wall op􀃉n into area [[#X13. EAST ARCHER POST]].

A secret door is set into the back of one of the alcoves on the north wall. It can be pulled open to area [[#X14. NORTH STAIRCASE]].

## X13. EAST ARCHER POST
==This narrow room has an arrow slit in the center of the south wall.==

The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The arrow slit looks down toward the temple floor (area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]), beneath the raised left arm of the great statue (area [[#X5A. GOD OF SECRETS]]).

## X14. NORTH STAIRCASE
When the characters open the secret door at the top of the stairs, read:

==A dusty corridor heads north, then bends to the east, descending a dark staircase. The air is thin, but heavy with the stench of death.==

Three 10-foot-long staircases with landings between them descend a total of 30 feet to area [[#X14A. COLLAPSED LOWER HALL]]. The stench grows stronger down the stairs.

### X14A. COLLAPSED LOWER HALL
==The stairs descend to a collapsed hall with a high ceiling and amber-glazed walls glazed. Rubble covers most of the floor, and a path through the rubble leads to an open doorway. A deathly stench seems to come from there.==

This ruined area once connected to area [[#X32. LOWER EAST HALL]], but an earth tremor caused the ceiling and walls to collapse. The ceiling here is 25 feet high.

Unless the characters douse their light sources and move quietly, the creatures in area [[#X33C. GHASTLY VAULT]] hear them approaching and prepare to attack.

## X15. SOUTHWEST ANNEX
This room contains a **gladiator** (CE female human), five **berserkers** (CE male and female humans), and one **dire wolf**. The gladiator and. the berserkers are bloodthirsty mountain folk, the dire wolf a servant of Strahd. The dire wolf can't be charmed or frightened.

When they aren't expecting trouble, the gladiator and the berserkers sit on the floor, sharpening their weapons, while the dire wolf sleeps in the middle of the room. The gladiator and the berserkers fight to the death. The dire wolf flees the temple (heading east, through areas
[[#X4. OVERLOOK]] and [[#X2. ENTRANCE]]) if reduced to fewer than half its hit points.

==Torches in sconces light this bare stone room. Six bedrolls made of stitched animal furs cover the floor. Cold air enters through a fissure in the southwest wall.==

Other than the berserkers' armor and weapons, there is nothing of value here. The berserkers are aware of the flameskulls ("fiery spirits") to the north and keep the doors to area [[#X17. UPPER WEST HALL]] closed.

A fissure has formed in the southwest wall. The gap is 2 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 15 feet deep. It leads outside (area [[#X1A. NARROW FISSURE]]).

A secret door in the south wall opens into area [[#X16. WEST SCROLL REPOSITORY]]. Neither the mountain folk nor the dire wolf knows of it.

DE VELOPMENT
The gladiator, Helwa, uses this room as a shelter while hunting in the mountains. She and her berserkers know nothing about the temple's history or purpose.
## X16. WEST SCROLL REPOSITORY
Apart from its location, this room is identical to area [[#X7. SECRET SCROLL REPOSITORY]].

## X17. UPPER WEST HALL
==The walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor are sheathed in amber. The southern half of the hall is scorched by fire, and a charred corpse lies on the floor here, under a burned fur cloak. Several amber doors lead from this hall, and three arrow slits are cut into the east wall. Floating in the middle of the hall are three skulls wreathed in green flame.==

Three **flameskulls** guard this hall, attacking creatures that enter. The flameskulls will not leave the hall. 

The charred corpse is all that remains of a wizard named Jakarion, who came to the Amber Temple seeking power. The flameskulls incinerated the wizard. 

The arrow slits look down on the temple (area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]).

TREASURE
Although the dead wizard's spellbook didn't survive, his staff did. It is a *staff of frost*. Imprinted on it is a fragment of the wizard's personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: "I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it." This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.

## X18. HALLWAY
==This twenty-foot-long, ten-foot-high hallway of bare stone I has an amber door at each end.==

Area [[#X17. UPPER WEST HALL]] lies beyond the door to the east, area [[#X21. WEST STAIRCASE]] beyond the door to the west.

## X19. POTION STOR AGE
==Stone blocks resembling tables stand in the center of this room covered in dust. Carved into the stone walls are niches filled with hundreds of dusty bottles. Cobwebs hang from wooden ladders that lean against the walls.==

The ceiling here is 15 feet high. The bottles contain the dried-up remains of potions that lost their efficacy long ago. The ladders were once used to reach the higher niches, but they can no longer support any weight.

A secret door is set in the north wall. It can be pulled open to reveal a staircase landing (area [[#X21. WEST STAIRCASE]]).

## X20. ARCHITECT'S ROOM
==Dominating this room is a twelve-foot-tall model of a dark castle with high walls and tall spires. Behind it, tucked in a corner, are some ruined furnishings and a wooden chest.==

In the months leading up to the construction of Castle Ravenloft, this room was occupied by the castle's architect, a wizard named Artimus. He built a scale model of the castle out of magically sculpted rock. Anyone who has seen the castle recognizes this replica for what it is.

The ceiling here is 15 feet high. A secret door in the south wall can be pulled open to a staircase landing (area [[#X21. WEST STAIRCASE]]).

TREASURE
The wooden chest contains an old map case in which Artimus kept floor plans of Castle Ravenloft, but the maps were lost long ago. The chest has a false bottom that can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Inside the hidden compartment is a *tome of understanding*.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's hidden in the miniature castle. The characters must smash their way into the castle to reach it.

## X21. WEST STAIRCASE
Three 10-foot-long staircases separated by 10-foot-square landings connect areas [[#X18. HALLWAY]] and [[#X36. LOWER WEST HALL]]. Thick dust covering the stairs has not been disturbed in ages.

The uppermost landing has secret doors set into its north and south walls. The south door opens into area [[#X19. POTION STOR AGE]], and the north door opens into area [[#X20. ARCHITECT'S ROOM]].

## X22. NORTHWEST ANNEX
When one of the doors to this room is opened, read:

==Torches in sconces illuminate a dining table in the center of the room. Covering the table is a magnificent feast that fills the hall with the rich smells of cooked meat, sweet vegetables, piping hot gravy, and wine.==

The ceiling her. e is 20 feet high. Amber doors lead south to a hallway (area [[#X18. HALLWAY]]) and east to a shattered balcony (area [[#X23. NORTHWEST BALCONY]]).

The table is real, but the torches, the feast, and the chairs are illusions created by a *programmed illusion* spell that triggers when a door to the room is opened. The illusion can be dispelled (DC 17).

Hidden in plain sight amid the feast on the table is a green copper ewer embossed with images of dancing bears, elks, and wolves. The ewer, like the table, isn't illusory. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ewer. If a character picks up the ewer, the illusions fade away (including the torches and their light), and seven **specters** materialize and attack whoever has the ewer.

TREASURE
Any poisonous liquid poured into the ewer is instantly transformed into an equal amount of sweet wine. Furthermore, a creature that grasps the ewer's handle can command the ewer to fill with 1 gallon of wine, and it can't produce more wine until the next dawn.

Many unscrupulous Barovians and Vistani would kill to obtain this ewer. Others would gladly pay for it or accept it as a gift.

## X23. NORTHWEST BALCONY
==This black marble balcony overhangs the northwest corner of the temple, the floor of which lies thirty feet below. Nearly half of the balcony has fallen away, and obvious cracks have formed near its ragged edge.==

This balcony is unsafe. Weight in excess of 250 pounds causes it to collapse. Any creature on the balcony when it collapses falls 30 feet to the temple floor below.

Characters can see an arrow slit east of the northern set of doors (see area [[#X25. WEST ARCHER POST]]).

## X24. WEST SHRINE
==This bare stone room consists of a foyer to the east and a shrine to the west. Candlesticks draped in cobwebs stand in the four corners of the foyer. In the shrine, a faceless obsidian statue stands in a raised alcove at the western end of the chamber. Slumped before the statue are two desiccated corpses in tattered garments. Two pairs of alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.==

The obsidian statue is 4 feet tall, weighs 250 pounds, and depicts the same nameless god that stands watch in the main temple (area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]). Any living creature that
enters this room must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be drawn to the statue as though affected by the sympathy effect of an *antipathy/sympathy* spell. The corpses lying in front of the statue are the remains of two human wizards who came here separately, failed their saving throws, and starved to death while under the spell's effect. The lich in area [[#X27. LICH'S LAIR]] destroyed the wizards' spellbooks and other possessions. Covering the statue or removing it from this shrine suppresses its magic and ends its sympathy effect on anyone.

A pair of amber doors in the east wall open into area [[#X25. WEST ARCHER POST]]. A secret door is set in the back of one of the northern alcoves. Pulling it open releases hundreds of skulls (see area [[#X26. SECRET ALCOVE]]).

## X25. WEST ARCHER POST
==This narrow room has an arrow slit in the center of the I south wall.==

The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The arrow slit looks down toward the temple floor (area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]), beneath the raised right arm of the great statue (area [[#X5A. GOD OF SECRETS]]).

## X26. SECRET ALCOVE
Two secret doors lead to this room. When either door is pulled open, read:

==Hundreds of skulls fall out of a cavity behind the door.==

This room has a 30-foot-high ceiling and is packed floor to ceiling with human skulls. It takes 5 minutes for a single character to clear a path into the room. Multiple characters can work together to clear a path more quickly. Once the skulls are cleared away, characters can search the room.

==Attached to the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this dark sepulcher is an upside-down iron chest with a barrel-shaped lid.==

The iron chest on the ceiling is held in place with *sovereign glue*, and its lid is sealed with an *arcane lock* spell. The chest is impervious to weapon damage. Prying it open requires a successful DC 25 Strength check, assuming the characters can reach it. The inside of the chest is lined with lead.

If the chest's lid is opened, the floor of this room disappears (as if affected by a *disintegrate* spell), creating a 10-foot-square hole above area [[#X39. PLUNDERED TREASURY]]. Creatures standing on the floor when it disappears fall 30 feet, landing in the northwest corner of area [[#X39. PLUNDERED TREASURY]].

The iron chest is empty.

## X27. LICH'S LAIR
==This fifteen-foot-high room contains the trappings of royalty: ornate furniture, exquisite rugs and tapestries, and decorative statuary. Everywhere you look are lit candelabras atop small tables. The beauty of the decor is undone by thick dust and cobwebs. Standing in the center of the room is a decrepit skeleton clad in tattered robes.==

==Red pinpoints of light burn in the skeleton's eye sockets. "Do I know you?" it asks.==

The **lich** has fewer hit points than normal (99 hit points), doesn't remember its name (Exethanter), and has forgotten all of its prepared spells. It does know its cantrips. In its current condition, the lich has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP). A *greater restoration* spell restores the lich's memory and all of its spells. Another casting of the spell restores its normal hit point maximum (135).

If the characters restore its memory, the lich gives them the passwords to all the locked doors in the Amber Temple (with the exception of the door into area [[#X28. HIDDEN PHYLACTERY]], where its phylactery is hidden). It also provides all the information pertaining to Strahd and the temple presented at the start of this chapter. If the characters think to ask, it provides them with the command words for any of the books in the library (area [[#X30. PRESERVED LIBRARY]]).

If the characters restore its body, it offers to escort them while they explore the temple. The other creatures that inhabit the temple don't threaten the characters as long as the lich is with them.

The lich defends itself if attacked and turns to dust if it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The lich assumes that the characters have come seeking knowledge and power. If it is inclined to help them, it tells them how the amber sarcophagi work (as explained in the "[[Amber Sarcophagi.png]]" sidebar). The lich has no alliance with or animosity toward Strahd, and no interest in challenging Strahd for control of Barovia.

The furnishings here are in poor condition and fall apart easily.

There are three secret doors in this room. The secret door to area [[#X28. HIDDEN PHYLACTERY]] has an *arcane lock* spell cast on it. The password to suppress the spell is "Exethanter."

TREASURE
The lich's ancient, bronze-covered spellbook sits on a rotted divan, in plain view. Inscribed on its spine is a title: *The Incants of Exethanter*. The spellbook contains all the spells on the lich's list of prepared spells (see the **lich** stat block in the *Monster Manual*). The lich attacks anyone who tries to take its spellbook.

## X28. HIDDEN PHYLACTERY
The secret door to this room has an arcane lock spell cast on it (see area [[#X27. LICH'S LAIR]] for details).

==Behind the secret door is a small, dusty room. Rising from the floor in the eastern half of the room is a scaly arm and claw clutching a small box made of bone.== 

The scaly arm is merely a carved pedestal. The bone box is Exethanter's phylactery. If it takes 20 or more radiant damage from a single source, the phylactery is destroyed.

## X29. SECRET ROOM
==Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room.==

The ceiling here is 10 feet high.

## X30. PRESERVED LIBRARY
==This stone library has twenty-foot-high walls and a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling. Covering the ceiling is a fresco that depicts angels being set ablaze in a hell. A black marble railing encloses a gold marble staircase that spirals gently down a thirty-foot-wide, thirty-foot-deep shaft to the north. Against the gray walls stand six ten-foot-tall, black marble bookcases. On their shelves are hundreds of well-preserved tomes. Embroidered rugs, chairs, and lit candelabras fill the southern half of the room.==

The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area [[#X42. AMBER VAULT]]. Peering over the railing reveals crates in that area.

There are no ladders here to reach the high bookshelves. (The wizards who built this place used *mage hand* spells.) All the books appear to have blank covers and empty pages. Holding a book while speaking its secret command word causes the book's text to magically appear. Only the lich in area [[#X27. LICH'S LAIR]] knows the command word for each book, and only if its memory is restored. A *true seeing* spell also allows one to see the magically obfuscated text. The tomes mostly contain vile, forbidden lore. Many spellbooks are hidden here, collectively holding every wizard spell in the *Player's Handbook*. 

A book that is taken from the library disintegrates as the magic that preserves it is dispelled. The room's furnishings, which are also magically preserved, deteriorate and become brittle if taken from the room.

The secret door in the center of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal an empty room (area [[#X29. SECRET ROOM]]). The one in the center of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal a staircase that descends 30 feet to another secret door leading to area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]].

![[Amber Temple Lower Level Map.jpg]]

## X31. CENTRAL CATACOMBS
These catacombs contain the moldy remains of the wizards who once defended the Amber Temple. Later generations of wizards who were corrupted by the evil of the temple smashed the amber sheaths covering the dead wizards' bodies and stole everything of value, leaving the formerly preserved corpses to rot.

==You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.==

If the characters enter these .catacombs, add:

==Tall, iron candlesticks stand in alcoves. Their candles ignite as you enter, casting flickering light upon the walls and causing the shattered amber to glitter.==

The magic candles ignite when a living creature enters the catacombs and melt away if taken from the area.

### X31A. WEST CATACOMBS
==More skeletal remains fill niches in the walls of this smaller annex, the amber husks that once preserved them smashed beyond repair.==

### X31B. EAST CATACOMBS
==The niches set into the wall of this annex lie empty, except for a thick coat of dust.==

No wizards were entombed here. This annex is empty.

## X32. LOWER EAST HALL
==The walls and ceiling of this great hall are coated in amber that glistens like fresh honey. Dust covers the black marble floor. To the north, the hall has collapsed, leaving a wall of rubble.==

==Many amber doors lead from this hall. Standi ng in front of the south door are three ugly women in tattered black gowns with brooms and black, pointed hats.==

An earth tremor collapsed the northern part of the hall. Three [[Barovian Witch]] are trying to
open the amber door to area [[#X33A. VAULT OF SHALX]] by trying different passwords, unaware that they could gain entry through the shaft in area [[#X6. SOUTHEAST ANNEX]]. Frustrated by their Jack of progress, they vent their rage by attacking the characters. The witches let loose their three [[Broom of Animated Attack]] while they cast spells.

DEVELOPMENT
If two of the witches are killed or incapacitated, the surviving witch attempts to escape by flying away on her broom. Only the witches can use the brooms of animated attack in this fashion.

## X33. AMBER VAULTS
Several of these amber-glazed rooms are located along the periphery of the complex. Each room contains two or more amber sarcophagi (see the "Amber Sarcophagi" sidebar).

![[Amber Sarcophagi.png]]
### X33A. VAULT OF SHALX
The amber door tot his room is sealed with an *arcane lock* spell. The password to suppress the spell is "Shalx." A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The door (AC 15, 30 hit points) can also be smashed. If the door is reduced to 0 hit points, necrotic energy fills the 30-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature in the area takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, turning to dust and bones if reduced to 0 hit points.

Adjust the following text if the creatures in this room have already been encountered and destroyed.

==This room has walls of glazed amber, a floor of red marble, and a rough-hewn shaft in the center of its ten-foot-high ceiling. Three amber sarcophagi stand in alcoves, and above each sarcophagus floats a human skull wreathed in green flame.==

Three **flameskulls** guard this room. They attack intruders on sight.

The shaft in the ceiling is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long, with abundant handholds. No ability check is required to climb it. The shaft leads up to area [[#X6. SOUTHEAST ANNEX]].

### X33C. GHASTLY VAULT
The amber door to this room hangs open, and the chamber reeks of death.

==This room has amber-glazed walls and a floor of dark green marble. Three amber sarcophagi stand in alcoves. Two feral humanoids with ghastly gray skin stare at you hungrily with three eyes-two normal eyes and a third lidless eye blinded by cataracts. Five more cling to the walls and ceiling.==

The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The seven hungry **ghasts** that lair here fight to the death. The **ghasts** have the following additional feature:

**Spider Climb.** The ghast can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### X33D. BREACHED VAVLT
The, amber door to this room hangs open.

==This room has amber-glazed walls and a floor of purplish-black marble. Two amber sarcophagi stand in alcoves to the west and east. A third sarcophagus that once stood in the north alcove lies shattered on the floor. Clustered in the middle of the room are four loathsome, hunched creatures. Each one has a single large, baleful eye.==

The creatures huddled in this room are four **nothics**- former wizards reduced to this evil state by their mad quest for forbidden lore. The nothics use their Weird Insight feature to pry secrets from the characters. Although this power is wickedly invasive, the nothics don't consider their prying to be offensive, and so they are taken aback if the characters retaliate. The nothics fight only if one of them is accosted, or if the characters try to destroy the amber sarcophagi.

Characters who touch the amber sarcophagi are offered dark gifts by the evil vestiges contained within them (see the "[[Amber Sarcophagi.png]]" sidebar).

The beneficiary gains the ability to speak and understand Infernal; if he of she doesn't already know the language. (The hell hounds understand no other language.) Sulfurous smoke issues from the beneficiary's pores whenever he or she speaks Infernal.

## X34. WIZARD'S BEDCHAMBER
==A white marble bed stands in the center of this bare stone room, its mattress long since rotted away. Golden hawks perch atop the bed's corner posts. The room's remaining furnishings have been reduced to dust-covered heaps. Cobwebs cover arcane sigils carved into the walls.==

The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The sigils that cover the walls were once wards designed to protect the room's contents from theft, but they have been bled of their magic and can no longer harm anyone.

TREASURE
The four golden hawks are worth 250 GP each.

## X35. SLEEPING GUARDIAN
==The furnishings of this bare stone room have succumbed to decrepitude. Standing in the center of the room, its head scraping the ten-foot-high ceiling, is a vaguely man-shaped construct made of dark wood and riveted iron. Its helmed head stares blindly in your direction. Cobwebs stretch from this terrible artifice to the wrecked furniture that surrounds it.==

This room was once a wizard's bedchamber. The construct is an incapacitated **shield guardian**. Its control amulet can be found in area [[#X9. LECTURE HALL]].
## X36. LOWER WEST HALL
==Glistening amber coats the walls and ceiling of this enormous hall like sculpted honey, and dust covers the black marble floor. The vaulted ceiling is twenty-five feet high. Set into the walls at a height of five feet are amber ledges lined with life-sized alabaster statues of cats, frogs, hawks, owls, rats, ravens, snakes, toads, and weasels. Many of the statues have fallen off their perches and lie shattered on the floor.==

==An amber door in the north wall stands open. Four other amber doors to the west and south stand closed.==

The animal statues represent different kinds of familiars, and they are harmless.

## X37. WIZARD'S BEDCHAMBER
==Furnishings made of ancient, colorless wood have collapsed under their own weight and now lie covered with cobwebs and dust.==

## X38. HAUNTED ROOM
==This room, once a bedchamber, is littered with broken furnishings. Scattered about the room are the remains of a bed, a wardrobe, two trunks, three tall candlesticks, a desk, a bookshelf, and several chairs. Torn-up books, old quill pens, and tattered clothes are also strewn about.==

The ceiling here is 10 feet high. A poltergeist (see the **specter** entry in the *Monster Manual*) haunts this room and telekinetically hurls broken furnishings at intruders so as not to give away its location.

TREASURE
A search of the room yields a wooden scroll tube containing an intact *spell scroll of wall of fire*.

## X39. PLUNDERED TREASURY
==The amber doors that once sealed this great stone room have been smashed, their pieces lying amid crushed bones, armor, and weapons.==

The ceiling here is 30 feet high and flat. A 10-foot-square hole in the northwest corner of the ceiling magically forms if the iron chest in area [[#X26. SECRET ALCOVE]] is opened.

An amber golem once stood guard here, but it escaped after thieves broke into the treasury and looted it. The golem has since made its way upstairs (see area [[#X10. NORTHEAST ANNEX]]).

Not all of the thieves escaped, and the pulverized remains of those who died here lie strewn upon the floor. Their restless spirits survive here as four poltergeists (see the **specter** entry in the  *Monster Manual*). The poltergeists can't leave the room and fight until destroyed.

## X40. SEALED TREASURY
The amber doors to the south are sealed with an *arcane lock* spell. The password to suppress the spell is "Dhaviton." A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The doors (AC 15, 60 hit points) can also be smashed. If the doors are reduced to 0 hit points, a *greater invisibility* spell is cast on the amber golem in this room. The spell lasts for 1 minute.

==Piles of treasure are heaped against the west and east walls of this stone room.==

If the golem is visible, add:

==A ten-foot-tall statue carved from amber in the likeness of a hawk-headed humanoid stands in a wide alcove to the north. Behind it, a crack has formed in the wall.==

The ceiling here is 30 feet high and flat. The statue in the northern alcove is an amber golem (use the stat block for the **stone golem** in the *Monster Manual*). It attacks any creature that disturbs the treasure. The golem can leave the room but can't leave the Amber Temple.

![[Amber Golem.png]]

See area [[#X41. FISSURE]] for a description of the cracks in the south wall.

FORTUNES OF RAVEN LOFT
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's buried in a random pile of treasure (roll a d6).

## X41. FISSURE
An earth tremor split the rock between areas [[#X40. SEALED TREASURY]] and [[X42]], creating two natural openings that are virtually side by side. The openings are 3 feet wide, 8 feet high, and 10 feet deep.

## X42. AMBER VAULT
==A golden marble staircase with a black marble railing hugs the north wall as it spirals gently up a thirty-foot-wide shaft. Lying in the middle of the room are six rotting wooden crates.==

==The amber-covered walls are sculpted to look like tentacles that entwine around marble bas-reliefs of kings, queens, pharaohs, and sultans attended by myriad slaves.==

==The west, south, and east walls contain alcoves, and standing in each alcove is a tall, rough block of amber. Two wide cracks have opened up in the south wall, spilling rubble and shattered pieces of amber onto the floor in the southeast corner of the room.==

The spiral staircase climbs 30 feet to area [[#X30. PRESERVED LIBRARY]]. See area [[#X41. FISSURE]] for a description of the cracks in the south wall.

Inside the wooden crates, buried in earth, are six **vampire spawn** created by Strahd from a dead party of adventurers. As soon as they hear intruders in the room, the vampire spawn burst out of their crates and attack, fighting until destroyed.

TELEPORT DESTINATION
Characters who teleport to this location from [[Chapter 4 - Castle Ravenloft#K78. BRAZIER ROOM]] arrive at the point marked T on the map.

AMBER SARCOPHAGI
Characters who touch the amber sarcophagi are offered dark gifts by the evil vestiges contained within them (see the "[[Amber Sarcophagi.png]]" sidebar earlier in this chapter). Kasimir will know when he touches the east sarcophagus in this area that he has found the dark gift he seeks.

**West Sarcophagus.** The vestige within this sarcophagus offers "the dark gift of the Vampyr" to any humanoid creature of evil alignment that touches it. The Vampyr's gift is the immortality of undeath. If the dark gift is accepted, its effect doesn't occur until the following conditions
are met, in the order given below. The creature becomes aware of the conditions only after accepting the dark gift. 
- The beneficiary slays another humanoid that loves or reveres him or her, then drinks the dead humanoid's blood within 1 hour of slaying it. 
- The beneficiary dies a violent death at the hands of one or more creatures that hate it.
When the conditions are met, the beneficiary instantly becomes a **vampire** under the Dungeon Master's control (use the stat block in the *Monster Manual*).
After receiving the dark gift, the beneficiary gains the following flaw: "I am surrounded by hidden enemies that seek to destroy me. I can't trust anyone."

**South Sarcophagus.** The vestige within this sarcophagus offers "the dark gift of Tenebrous" to any humanoid creature of evil alignment that can cast 9th-level wizard spells. Tenebrous's gift is the secret of lichdom. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the knowledge needed to perform the following tasks:
- Craft a phylactery and imbue it with the power to contain the beneficiary's soul
- Concoct a potion of transformation that turns the beneficiary into a lich
Construction of the phylactery takes 10 days. Concocting the potion takes 3 days. The two items can't be crafted concurrently. When the beneficiary drinks the potion, he or she instantly transforms into a **lich** under the Dungeon Master's control (use the stat block in the *Monster Manual*, altering the Lich's prepared spells as desired).
The beneficiary of this dark gift gains the following flaw: "All I care about is acquiring new magic and arcane knowledge."

**East Sarcophagus.** The vestige within this sarcophagus offers the dark gift of Zhudun, the Corpse Star. Zhudun's gift is the power to raise the ancient dead. As an action, the beneficiary of this dark gift can touch the remains of a dead creature and restore it to life. The effect is identical to that of the *resurrection* spell, except that it works regardless of how long the creature has been dead. After it has been used once, the dark gift vanishes. The beneficiary of this dark gift takes on a corpselike appearance and is easily mistaken for an undead.

# SPECIAL EVENTS
Two dusk elves are drawn to the Amber Temple for different reasons. You can use one or both of the following special events while the characters explore the temple.

## RAHADIN'S PRAYER
Strahd's loyal chamberlain, [[Rahadin]], believes that his master forged a pact with the nameless
god of secrets to whom the Amber Temple is dedicated. The dusk elf comes to the temple on occasion to petition the dark god into releasing his master from his torment.

Rahadin rides a *phantom steed* along Tsolenka Pass to the Amber Temple and kneels before the great statue in area [[#X5. TEMPLE OF LOST SECRETS]]. (The arcanaloth that guards the temple
knows Rahadin and doesn't harm him. The arcanaloth and the flameskulls don't attack other visitors until Rahadin is killed or leaves.) Rahadin then pulls out a live toad, swallows it whole as a sacrifice, and offers a gesture of supplication to the secret god.

DEVELOPMENT
Rahadin knows that Strahd will deal with the characters when he sees fit. If the characters confront the dusk elf, he defends himself but won't cause them any permanent harm. Strahd's chamberlain would sooner die than allow himself to be captured. Rahadin doesn't divulge his reason for visiting the temple, or even who is he or what role he serves. Left to his own devices, he rides back to Castle Ravenloft.

## KASIMIR's DARK GIFT
If [[Kasimir Velikov]] (see [[Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N9A. KASIMIR'S HOVEL]]) finds his way to area [[#X42. AMBER VAULT]] and accepts the dark gift of Zhudun, he then asks the characters to accompany him to the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft so that he can restore the life of his centuries-dead sister, Patrina Velikovna (see [[Chapter 4 - Castle Ravenloft#CRYPT 21]]).

DEVELOPMENT
If Kasimir succeeds in his quest, the newly resurrected Patrina (NE female dusk elf **archmage**) feigns repentance until she regains her strength and her spells, whereupon she travels to Castle Ravenloft and attempts to return to Strahd, seeking to become his vampire bride at last. The mutilation of her brother at the hands of Rahadin, Strahd's chamberlain, doesn't sit well with her. She hopes to avenge her brother and distract the characters by setting them on a path. to killing Rahadin, who has long opposed her Marriage to Strahd.

Strahd has lost interest in Patrina as a consort. Given the chance, he turns her into a vampire spawn and puts her back in her crypt- a fate she would do everything in her power to prevent. Her attraction to Strahd is outmatched by a desire to increase her own power. She is no one's plaything.
