# CHARACTER BACKGROUND
During character creation, players can select the following background for their characters, with your approval. It is appropriate for any character or campaign associated with eeriness or horror.

## HAUNTED ONE
You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You've tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can't be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose one of Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival

**Languages:** Choose one exotic language (Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon)

**Equipment:** Monster hunter's pack (see sidebar), one trinket of special significance (choose one or roll on the Gothic Trinkets table in this appendix)

MONSTER HUNTER'S PACK
You can buy a monster hunter's pack for 33 GP, which is cheaper than buying the items in it individually. It includes a chest, a crowbar, a hammer, three wooden stakes, a holy symbol, a flask of holy water, a set of manacles, a steel mirror, a flask of oil, a tinderbox, and 3 torches.

### FEATURE: HEART OF DARKNESS
Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.

### HARROWING EVENT
Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table.
