    - Fish
        - I know the book says there aren't fish in Lake Zarovich. Fine. But there are still plenty of rivers and other small lakes where Barovians can fish.
        - There are likely Carp, Perch, Pike, and Trout in Barovia.
- Farming and Edibles
    - most of these crops usually have darker leaves and vines from the lack of sunlight.  Also remember that most of products of these crops will be smaller and under-grown from the lack of sunlight.
    - Barovian Crops: Carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes, radishes, cabbage, mustard greens, kale, and collards.
- Wine
	- There is only wine, no other beverages, no beer, no mead, no whisky
