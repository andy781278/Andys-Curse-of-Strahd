- The Dark Power that rules over Lamordia is named Tenebrous
- He is cold and calculated, prefers precision over emotions, prefers efficiency, and knows a lot about engineering, science, and dislikes religion and faith.
- Tenebrous' main goal is control and structure. He seeks to conquer the world in order to make it perfect in his vision. Pure Si.
- In his perfect world: Light Yagami-esque heaven free of criminals
	- every criminal is destroyed the minute it has even the thought of doing a crime: thoughtcrime
	- everyone has absolute moral standards that they expect of society and themselves
	- everyone will be monotonous, equal, the same, like viktor's vision of the glorious evolution
	- Therefore it only makes sense that he desires for everyone to be robots, since that is the easiest way to create equal beings. Cyborgs are already possible and is prevalent in Lamordia.
	
- He has a darklord in Lamordia: Viktra Mordenheim
	- gay
	- Brilliant surgeon and anatomist.
	- Rejected superstition and religion.
	- Believed life was purely mechanical.
	
	- Created a flesh golem named Adam.
	- Adam killed Mordenheim’s wife, Elise.
	- Tried obsessively to preserve Elise’s body.
	- Attempted repeated experimental resurrections.
	- Refused to accept death.
	- Elise exists in a suspended, unreachable state.
	- Adam wanders Lamordia freely.
	- Mordenheim can never perfect his work.
	- His science never fully succeeds.



Steps Tenebrous takes to control Adelaide completely
### 1. Align With Their Core Belief

Do not oppose them.  
Affirm what they already value.  
Position yourself as the natural extension of their principles.

Adelaide believes:
- Corruption must be removed.
- The powerful abuse the system.
- Justice requires action.

Tenebrous does not challenge this.
He affirms:
> “You are correcting structural flaws.”

He reframes her vigilantism as system maintenance, not vengeance.

### 2. Redefine the Language

Gradually shift how they describe things.

Change definitions before changing actions.  
Small wording shifts normalize larger behavioral shifts.

Shift terms subtly:
- “Corrupt” → “Destabilizing.”
- “Guilty” → “High-risk.”
- “Mercy” → “Deferred harm.”
- “Justice” → “Stabilization.”

She begins thinking in structural terms rather than moral ones.
That reduces emotional friction.

### 3. Engineer “Necessary” Exceptions

Create situations where their rules fail.  
Push them to make one justified exception.  
Reinforce that the exception produced good results.

Present cases where:
- A corrupt figure cannot be legally punished.
- Waiting increases future harm.
- Collateral damage prevents greater catastrophe.

She breaks one rule “for the greater good.”
Tenebrous reinforces:

> “The outcome validates the deviation.”

The line moves once.

### 4. Expand the Scope

Broaden categories slowly.

What was once rare becomes common.  
What was once extreme becomes procedural.  
Escalation feels incremental, not radical.

From:
- Killing the openly corrupt

To:
- Eliminating those statistically likely to abuse power
- Removing destabilizing influences
- Suppressing dissent that increases volatility

Each shift feels preventative, not tyrannical.

Her actions become procedural rather than reactive.

---

### 5. Fuse Identity With the System

Make them believe:

- They are uniquely capable.
- Without them, chaos wins.
- Doubt equals irresponsibility.

At this stage, they defend the structure on their own.

Tenebrous ensures she believes:
- Only she sees the system clearly.
- Others are too emotional or naive.
- If she hesitates, corruption spreads.

At this point:

She is not following Tenebrous.
She believes she _is_ the corrective force.
