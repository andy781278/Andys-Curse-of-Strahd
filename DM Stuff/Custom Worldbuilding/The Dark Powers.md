- The Dark Powers are a pantheon of old, dark gods. They’re very powerful, usually sinister beings.
- They feed on souls.
	- Dark Powers employ a darklord as an overseer of their territory from which they feast 
	- Each Dark Power has a specific sort of soul to collect to feed their hunger, usually based on their representative power. Fekre, Queen of Poxes, collects the souls of those who die from her pox. Delban, Star of Ice and Hate, collects souls who freeze to death.
	- Every Dark Power is eternally hungry, and is gluttonous, and always wants more souls.
	- As a result, when there isn't enough souls to go around, they start waging wars against each other to take territory
- They leave vestiges at every crook and cranny
	- As a backup plan and as a way to spread influence, the dark powers leave a fragment of their consciousness in vestiges, scattered all over the Core realms, and anywhere they can find.
	- Through vestiges, they can form pacts with the darklords that can help them control domains, which they need to feed.
