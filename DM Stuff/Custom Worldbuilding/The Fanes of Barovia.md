- In a general sense, the land was separated into three Fanes, or environments: The Swamp Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Mountain Fane. This isn't the exact definition of a fane, but for the sake of this history it's the easiest way to picture them.

- The forest folk of old used to worship a trio of archfey known as the Ladies Three. The Ladies were extremely powerful nature goddess who watched over the valley. They were:

	- The Huntress of the Mountain Fane
	
	- The Weaver of the Swamp Fane
	
	- The Seeker of the Forest Fane
	
- The Ladies of the Wood almost never showed themselves to the people that worshiped them. Instead, they would appear in auguries, dreams, and omens, speaking through the mouths of animals and in the wind that mused the leaves on the trees.

### Shrines
- The people of the valley used to worship the Ladies through a series of shrines scattered across the land, some small and some large. The three most prominent shrines were located inside large stone circles that still stand during the present time of the campaign.
        
	- The swamp shrine is the circle of stones in Berez.
            
	- The mountain shrine is the circle atop Yesterhill.
            
	- And the forest shrine is the collection of monoliths behind Old Bonegrinder.
            
- The worship of the Ladies usually came in the form of minor religious practices and offerings. The offerings were usually things like, "The best fruits from the first harvest" or "the antlers of a buck we killed on hunt." Sometimes the people left small, carved statues or other bits of artistic labor.
        
- The practices were usually communes with nature, where folk would wonder into the woods and live entirely alone in respect for the Ladies. Those who survived would return home spiritually awakened. Other rituals were long nights spent in respect and worship or village wide pilgrimages to the major shrines.
        
### The Fall of the Ladies
    
- The Ladies presided over the valley until Strahd conquered the land. Strahd, seeing the power of the fanes, desecrated the three main shrines to the ladies and reconsecrated them in his own image, giving him dominion over the valley. Now, Strahd is literally, "The Land."
        
- By taking over the Fanes, Strahd has the following benefits:
        
	- The permanent protection of a _nondetection_ spell
	- Resistance to Fire, Cold, and Lightning damage
	- +4 to his Armor Class
            
	- With the combined control of all three Fanes, he controls the waters, winds, and wildlife in the valley. The only of Strahd's environmental powers that does _not_ come from the Fanes is the ever overcast sky. That comes from Vampyr.
            
### Reinstating the Ladies
    
- Part of defeating Strahd will entail disconnecting him from the land. He's obscenely strong at the moment, even for a Darklord. Breaking down his power is key to his fall.
	
- To reconsecrate the shrines and therefore bring back the Ladies of the Wood, certain rituals will have to be performed.
	
	- To reconsecrate the shrine of the Mountain Fane at Yesterhill, someone must survive a journey through the caverns under the Gulthias Tree and prove the worth of their soul. (A dungeon of my own making detailed in a later post.)
		
	- To reconsecrate the shrine of the Forest Fane behind Old Bonegrinder, the players must face one of their possible dark futures, to understand just how far they could have fallen.
		
	- To reconsecrate the shrine of the Swamp Fane in Berez, someone must provide a great service to the Weaver to prove their respect and servitude. More specific to the campaign, someone will have to kill Baba Lysaga, the witch currently poisoning the swamp fane, and present her heart at the shrine.
