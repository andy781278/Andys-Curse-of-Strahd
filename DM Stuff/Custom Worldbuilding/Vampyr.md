- The Dark Power that rules over Barovia is named Vampyr. 
- Vampy is chaotic, domineering, and desires power for the sake of it
- Tyranny, predation, obsession, madness.

- Vampyr has a vestige at the Amber Temple.
- Strahd is Vampyr’s chosen champion to rule over Barovia, therefore giving Vampyr dominion over this demiplane.
- Vampyr collects the souls of those who die from insanguination (extreme blood loss). So, a champion who quite literally needs to drink blood is an excellent way to collect. Basically, anybody who dies in Barovia by vampire bite looses their soul to Vampyr.
- The Soulless
	- While there were once a plethora of souls in the valley - so many so that there weren't enough physical bodies to house them all at any given time - now there simply aren't enough. Those who have died to the vampires in Barovia over the many centuries have lost their souls to Vampyr and the mists prevent any new souls from entering the land.
	
- During their time in Barovia, your players should start attracting the attention of Vampyr.
- Vampyr will adapt to the PC best friend persona if they deem PC worthy and wants them to become the successor.
- If there comes a time when one of your players is in a pretty dire situation and happens to die, you can have Vampyr come to their aid. After all, an evil god probably doesn’t want to loose its chosen plaything. Players can temporarily enter a Beast Mode version of themselves as they’re overwhelmed with the ability of the Dark Power. They can then use their temporary power to crush their enemies before becoming drained again.
