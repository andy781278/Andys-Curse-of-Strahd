### Demiplanes of Dread
- The Demiplanes of Dread
    - Once upon a time, there was an entire dimension called the Core as big and wondrous as Faerun. But, over the course of time, this dimension was split into a multitude of small, isolated dimensions. Demiplanes, to be more precise. Barovia is one of these demiplanes.
    - [Click here](http://www.fraternityofshadows.com/PortraitHall/JesterMaps/CoreMistyBordersPoster.png) for a nice map of the Core, complete with misty borders. Barovia is near the middle bottom.
- The Dark Powers
    - Why did the big dimension get split up? Because of the Dark Powers.
    - The Dark Powers are essentially a pantheon of old, dark gods. They’re very powerful, usually sinister beings.
    - Each demiplane has a ruling Dark Power. That god basically owns that particular mini world. However, these gods cannot actually own a plane just by wanting it. Instead, they choose a champion amongst mortals and form a sort of pact with them. That mortal becomes the Dark Power’s anchor to that particular demiplane.
    - The Dark Powers are always at war with one another, essentially fighting for real estate. It’s possible for one Dark Power to supplant another as ruler of a particular demiplane, provided they too have a chosen champion in that plane.
    - They feed on mortal souls. However, those souls only exist in realms in which they can't live. Sure, they can enter a mortal realm for a short time, but they can never stay. Every so often, they can reach out and corrupt a soul ripe for stealing, but it's hard work and doesn't happen consistently. Collecting souls through a champion (a shark) is a much better method of finding food.
    - Each Dark Power has a specific sort of soul to collect to feed their hunger, usually based on their representative power. Fekre, Queen of Poxes, collects the souls of those who die from her pox. Delban, Star of Ice and Hate, collects souls who freeze to death.
    
#### Vampyr
- The Dark Power that rules over Barovia is named Vampyr. 
    - Vampyr is trapped in a vestige at the Amber Temple.
    - Strahd is Vampyr’s chosen champion to rule over Barovia, therefore giving Vampyr dominion over this demiplane.
	
    - Vampyr collects the souls of those who die from insanguination (extreme blood loss). So, a champion who quite literally needs to drink blood is an excellent way to collect. Basically, anybody who dies in Barovia by vampire bite looses their soul to Vampyr.
	- The Soulless
	    - While there were once a plethora of souls in the valley - so many so that there weren't enough physical bodies to house them all at any given time - now there simply aren't enough. Those who have died to the vampires in Barovia over the many centuries have lost their souls to Vampyr and the mists prevent any new souls from entering the land.
    
    - During their time in Barovia, your players should start attracting the attention of Vampyr.
    - Vampyr will adapt to the PC best friend persona if they deem PC worthy and wants them to become the successor.
    - If there comes a time when one of your players is in a pretty dire situation and happens to die, you can have Vampyr come to their aid. After all, an evil god probably doesn’t want to loose its chosen plaything. Players can temporarily enter a Beast Mode version of themselves as they’re overwhelmed with the ability of the Dark Power. They can then use their temporary power to crush their enemies before becoming drained again.

### Druidic Tribes
- Druidic Tribes
    - _Long_ before Strahd's reign and any official settlement, the valley was once home to a collection of nomadic, druidic tribes. These folk lived entirely off the land and were completely unsettled. They are, in fact, the ancient ancestors of the druids and barbarians found in the book.
    - Forest Folk
        - I've never liked referring to these people as "Druids" or "Barbarians" in game, because it automatically tips off your players as to the basic stats and abilities of the enemies they're facing. It can break immersion, even if only a little.
        - Instead, I refer to these tribes of primitive peoples as the Forest Folk. Or, if we're referring to the tribes that live in the mountains, the Mountain Folk. Simple, clean, and easy to remember.
        - In the present date of the campaign, the native Barovians still refer to the wild peoples who live in the woods as forest folk. Or, sometimes, less flattering terms.
#### The Fanes of Barovia
- The forest folk of old used to worship a trio of archfey known as the Ladies Three. The Ladies were extremely powerful nature goddess who watched over the valley. They were:
	- The Huntress of the Mountain Fane
	- The Weaver of the Swamp Fane
	- The Seeker of the Forest Fane
- In the very early years of his vampiric reign, Strahd set about making himself even more powerful, so that no one could challenge his post.
- Strahd committed three terrible acts of desecration at the main shrines to the Ladies Three and stole their power over the valley. The Ladies, while still alive at the time of the campaign, are almost completely powerless now.
### Strahd
- Firstly, STRAHD CANNOT DIE.
    - This is the very first and most important change I made to the campaign. Strahd is quite literally immortal. Not because he’s a vampire, but because he’s connected to a Dark Power. Even if you’ve got a band of level 30 characters all beating him to a pulp, Strahd would simply be resurrected the following dusk. Barovia is eternally under his control and Strahd takes great pleasure in this fact.
    - In the second third of the campaign or later, various NPCs can actually state this fact to the players. "Other adventures have come and killed Strahd before, you know. But he comes back. He always comes back..."
- Secondly, Strahd is _Obscenely_ Powerful
    - He isn't just a high leveled enemy. Even if he weren't immortal from his connection to Vampyr, a team of level 20 PCs would have trouble fighting him.
        - There's a popular CR 27 version of Strahd out there if you'd like specific stats. However, just buffing him in every way possible and then giving him every spell on the Wizard list is more than enough to build a working stat block.
    - Why is Strahd so powerful? Because of the Fanes of Barovia. Strahd stole power from three very powerful nature goddesses when he desecrated their shrines. This power is why Strahd has control over the elements and weather in Barovia. This power is why Strahd is, "The Land."
### Ireena
- And Lastly, Ireena
    - Ireena is a PC
        - If you can somehow transfer Ireena's narrative function to a PC, eliminating her as an NPC altogether, that'd be ideal. Now, Strahd is after a PC because that player is his reincarnated love. This makes things _very_ personal to the players and makes them the center of the plot.
        - If this option is of interest to you, I highly recommend checking out my [Village of Barovia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8xu9lo/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_the_village_of/) chapter. It details this process more thoroughly.
    - Ireena as an NPC Doesn't get a Happy Ending
        - I'll detail this more in a later post, but know that Ireena is pretty much doomed. I have some of this written in my [Village of Barovia Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8xu9lo/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_the_village_of/) and will include much more in a future post on the Shrine of the White Sun in Kresk.
        - Forcing Ireena into a sad ending basically makes her a martyr for the narrative. Her death or other sad fall is no different from that obligatory parent murder in the beginning of so many action movies. Tragedy breeds heroes.

    - Fish
        - I know the book says there aren't fish in Lake Zarovich. Fine. But there are still plenty of rivers and other small lakes where Barovians can fish.
        - There are likely Carp, Perch, Pike, and Trout in Barovia.
- Farming and Edibles
    - most of these crops usually have darker leaves and vines from the lack of sunlight.  Also remember that most of products of these crops will be smaller and under-grown from the lack of sunlight.
    - Barovian Crops: Carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes, radishes, cabbage, mustard greens, kale, and collards.
- Wine
	- There is only wine, no other beverages, no beer, no mead, no whisky
### Death
- After a character dies, have them come back as a ghost (not an actual ghost monster, btw). After all, their soul can’t leave Barovia because of the mists, so even canonically it makes sense.
- Possession
    - As a ghost, the PC is invisible and can't interact with the living world in any way. The other players can't see or hear the dead PC at all.
    - However, the ghost player has the ability to temporarily possess other intelligent creatures (must have the aptitude for language), so that they can continue to interact with the campaign. When trying to possess a creature, they must enter a charisma contest with the possessed. On a success, the dead PC gains full control of the creature's body. While they keep their own mental stats and abilities, they must use the physical stats of the possessed creature.
    - Possession lasts up to 3 hours, at which point the PC ghost is expelled from the body. They must take a short rest before they can attempt possession again. If the PC attempts to possess the same creature as before, the creature has advantage on their charisma contest to fend off possession.
##### The Mist Wall
- As a ghost, the PC is still technically attached to their body, even if they possess another creature, and cannot go farther than 300 ft from their corpse. At that radius, the dead PC can see an obtrusive wall of mist 360 degrees around them. If the ghost PC approaches the mist, they can see ominous, gargantuan dark shapes moving within (Dark Powers) as well as see the distant shapes of other dead humanoids running in the mists (dead Barovians waiting to be reincarnated and trying to hide from the prowling Dark Powers). Every day the PC remains dead, the radius of the mist wall shrinks by 30 ft.
- While a ghost, a PC has 1d8+2 days to be resurrected into their own body. After that, their body becomes too decayed to properly sustain life. The PC has 10 days (until the mist wall shrinks completely) to be resurrected at all, possibly into another body. This can be a constructed creature without a soul, like Vasilka, or a soulless Barovian. The Abbot, Jeny Greenteeth, and Madam Eva are the only ones capable of tying a soul to a new vessel. Once the mist wall closes and consumes the PC ghost, they are officially and irrevocably dead and have to roll a new character.
